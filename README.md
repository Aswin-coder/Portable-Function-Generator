# Portable-Function-Generator
Function generator can generate all kinds of wave like sine, square, triangle. All the waves can be extended up to 12 MHz frequency. It is based on AD9833 IC so that the output voltage will be only 500mv. But by using Op Amp as amplifier the signal can be amplified up to 12 volts.
